# what does each method return

arr = [15, 7, 18, 5, 12, 8, 5, 1]

puts arr.index(5)  #should return 3 which is the first index location of the number 5 in the array

# puts arr.index[5] # no idea what this is going to return

puts arr[5]  # this will return 8 which is the object in the 5th element position since it starts at 0
