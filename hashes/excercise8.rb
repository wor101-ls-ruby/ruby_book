# write a program that creates an anagram from the words in the array below

words =  ['demo', 'none', 'tied', 'evil', 'dome', 'mode', 'live',
          'fowl', 'veil', 'wolf', 'diet', 'vile', 'edit', 'tide',

# create a new array where the string in each element is re-arranged in alphabetical order
# once in alphabetical order run loop for each element to see if it is equal to any others
# for each element that is equal to another save it's index location into an array
# then use the index locations to create a new multi-dimensional array from the words array

# this creates a 2 dimensional array. each element is an array where each letter of the word is an element. they are sorted alphabetically and rejoined into a one dimensional array
words_ordered = words.map { |word| word.chars.sort.join }
